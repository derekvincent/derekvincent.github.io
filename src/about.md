I am Technologist and Solution Architect working primarily in the SAP enterprise space for the past three decades. An area I have always focused on and specialized in was the boundaries between what was generally considered traditional enterprise and the new hotness in technology. Because of this, I find myself constantly hacking away at new technology and trends to see how they can be applied in different spaces. 

Aside from playing with computers, I am also a [rally co-driver](https://www.rallysputnik.com/), rally event co-ordinator and planner. I also always seem to spend more time than planned with the kids at barns, horse shows, ice rinks, and race tracks.
