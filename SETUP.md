# Kemikal.io Blog Site

## Design 

A simple and clean blog using the Eleventy engine and the eleventy-duo templates as a starting point. Features I am building towards: 
- Simple maintenance and publishing, want to spend more time writing content than the site
- Simple hosting with automation 
- Flexible 
- SEO setup 
- Analytic monitoring 
- Have all article content contained in the same location (folder for article and images/videos) 
- Potential to automate posting ie. TinaCMS/Notion 
- Commenting system 
- Remove potential lockin
